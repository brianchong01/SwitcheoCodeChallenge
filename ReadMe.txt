For Problem 2:

1. Change directory in command prompt to the folder with "SwitcheoProblem2.html"

2. Start a python server by typing "python -m http.server". This is to allow required permissions to fetch data from prices.json

3. Open "localhost:8000/SwitcheoProblem2.html" in browser:)

For Problem 3:

I have limited exposure to React so I am not able to attempt this problem very well. However, I have tried the problem to the best of my abilities by going through as many React tutorials online as I could in the limited amount of time I had. I hope I get the chance to learn more at Switcheo!
